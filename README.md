# SMS Spam Detection System Using NLP

## Project Overview
The **SMS Spam Detection System Using NLP** is a machine learning-based project designed to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process text data and uses machine learning models to achieve accurate predictions. It also includes a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for real-time spam detection.



## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using NLP techniques.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Model training and selection with multiple classifiers.
- Real-time prediction via a web application.
- Deployment-ready code for easy hosting.



## Technologies Used
The following technologies and libraries were used to build this project:

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
  - WordCloud
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Streamlit



## Dataset
- **Name**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- **Details**: This dataset contains over 5,500 SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam). The dataset was preprocessed to remove duplicates and null values, resulting in a final dataset of 5,169 messages.



## Installation and Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone <https://github.com/Tejaswi-04/Project-SMS.git>
$ cd sms-spam-detection
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.12 or above). Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application
